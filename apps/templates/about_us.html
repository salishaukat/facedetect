                        <p>FindMeBahamas, a digital search database for missing persons developed out of concern for the scale of missing persons after Hurricane Dorian; a Category 5 hurricane that ripped through two (2) major islands in The Bahamas, Abaco & Grand Bahama.</p>
                        <p>FindMeBahamas leverages facial recognition and blockchain to match missing persons based on photos uploaded by loved ones or, shelter officials. FindMeBahamas also generates for each user a 6 digit ID number, providing a digital ID for governments and shelters to cross check identities of persons. </p>
                        <p>CEO of Bluestone Technologies, John Bridgewater, rallied up his team to develop FindMeBahamas as a result of the terrifying experience of his missing grandmother, step-grandfather and brother after the storm.</p>
                        <p>A native of Grand Bahama Island, John felt a need to do something for when this occurs again. The Bahamas is geographically situated in a hurricane belt and is prone to yearly hurricanes. John sought a need to be ready for when it does occur again in The Bahamas and is currently building for when other neighboring countries experience the same.</p>
                        <p>These networks confirm the prowess of Bahamian technical expertise to contribute to social good.</p>
